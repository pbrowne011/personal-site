Hi there! My name is Patrick Browne, and I'm a student from Massachusetts.
This is my personal website, where I highlight some of my projects.

Right now, I am studying computer science and statistics at
[Boston University](https://bu.edu). I am also working on research with
[Professor Appavoo](https://jappavoo.github.io/) into improving program
execution at a low level using neural networks.

Previously, I worked at a startup called ProPhone (now
[Topline Pro (YC W21)](https://www.toplinepro.com/)), where I helped service
professionals to grow their businesses online. Before that, I studied finance
and applied math at [Notre Dame](nd.edu) for two years.

Areas that I am interested in include compilers and operating systems,
cryptography, machine learning/AI, and probability. Please reach out, I always
enjoy meeting new people!
