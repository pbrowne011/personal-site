Hi there! This is my personal website, meant to be a reference for the projects that I have worked on in the past. It's a bit empty, as I haven't done many projects yet. I'll try to think up something more clever using Markdown for this description when I get the chance.

Right now, I am studying computer science at [Boston University](https://bu.edu). Previously, I worked at a startup called ProPhone (now [Topline Pro (YC W21)](https://www.toplinepro.com/)), where I helped service professionals to grow their businesses online. I also studied finance and applied math at [Notre Dame](nd.edu) for two years, and was involved with many of the finance clubs and projects at the school.

I am interested in learning as much as possible about software! Specifically, I am interested in backend and full stack development, artificial intelligence, robotics, and more. Some other interests include golf, card games, math puzzles, venture investing, effective altruism, and more. Feel free to reach out!
