Hi there! My name is Patrick Browne, and I'm a student from northern MA. This is my personal website, meant to be a reference for the projects that I have worked on in the past and those that I'm working on today.

Right now, I am studying computer science at [Boston University](https://bu.edu). Previously, I worked at a startup called ProPhone (now [Topline Pro (YC W21)](https://www.toplinepro.com/)), where I helped service professionals to grow their businesses online. I also studied finance and applied math at [Notre Dame](nd.edu) for two years, and was involved with the Investment Club and Student International Business Council (SIBC) projects.

Areas that I am interested in include artificial intelligence (deep learning, LLMs, AGI), high-performance computing (compilers, parallel computing) and probability and statistics (especially in finance). Please reach out, I always enjoy meeting new people!
