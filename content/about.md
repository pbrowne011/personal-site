My name is Pat Browne. I like to build things, and to understand how they work.
This blog is one of the places where I do that.

I'm currently studying [computer science](https://www.bu.edu/cs/) and
[statistics](https://www.bu.edu/stat/) at 
[Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/). Specific areas that I am interested 
in include compilers and operating systems, cryptography, machine learning/AI,
probability, financial markets, and number theory. You can email me at 
pjbrowne011 [at] gmail [dot] com.
