Hi, I'm Patrick.

I like to build things, and to understand how stuff works. I'm interested in
systems-level programming (OS, embedded), probability, and cryptography. I also
enjoy golf, books, and reading other's blogs. I'm currently studying statistics
and computer science at Boston University, graduating this December.

Email me at pjbrowne011 [at] gmail [dot] com - I'm always interested in meeting
new people.
