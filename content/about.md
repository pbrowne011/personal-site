Hi there! My name is Pat Browne.

I like to build things, and to understand how they work. This blog is one of the
places where I do that. I'm interested in systems-level programming (OS,
embedded), probability, and cryptography. In addition to these subjects, I also
enjoy golf, books, and reading other's blogs. I'm currently studying statistics
and computer science at Boston University, graduating this December.

To contact, email me at pjbrowne011 [at] gmail [dot] com - I'd love to hear from
you.
