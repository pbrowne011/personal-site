## What I'm working on

{{< project 
    title="Systems Research"
    image="/img/projects/research.png"
    tags="Machine Learning,Systems,Python" >}}
From our proposal: "Professor Appavoo and his research group have, for a long
time, been looking at ways to apply machine learning to predict the execution
of a computer... In this project, we hope to supplement and expand on this work
with a concrete data-driven study. In particular, we hope to quantify if and
how neural networks (or other appropriate machine learning mechanisms) can be
trained on low-level data of a systemâ€™s operation."

{{< project 
    title="hex-calc"
    image="/img/projects/hex-calc.jpg"
    tags="Embedded,C,Electronics" >}}
Simple Hex/Binary/Decimal calculator inspired by HP-16C and TI
Programmer. Soldered and programmed a calculator designed by
[Eric Hazen](https://edf.bu.edu/ESH/). Currently implementing "woodworking mode"
to convert between metric and imperial units on an ATMega328P.

    title="Autocom"
    image="/img/projects/autocom.gif"
    repo="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pbrowne011.autocom"
    tags="TypeScript,VS Code,LLM" >}}
Autocom is a VS Code extension that automatically generates both natural
language comments and Doxygen documentation for your code using AI models such
as GPT-4 and Claude Sonnet 3.5.-->

## What I've worked on

{{< project 
    title="DFA Simulator"
    image="/img/projects/dfa.png"
    repo="https://github.com/pbrowne011/dfa"
    tags="C,Automata Theory" >}}
A program written in C that takes a defined .dfa file and an input string, and
returns whether that input string is accepted or not by the given dfa. I may
add NFA functionality to this as well at some point.

{{< project 
    title="Cribdle"
    image="/img/projects/cribdle.png"
    repo="https://cribdle.com"
    tags="Website,JS" >}}
Cribdle is a cribbage game based on Wordle. Players aim to maximize their point
total by selecting the best cards to discard.

{{< project 
    title="Cubert"
    image="/img/projects/cubert.png"
    repo="https://github.com/pbrowne011/cubert"
    tags="Python,Algorithms" >}}
A project to implement different algorithms to solve a Rubik's cube, each with a
different definition of "efficiency". I implement a layered algorithm approach,
and am working on building an implementation of the Thistlethwaite algorithm.

{{< project 
    title="VaR"
    image="/img/projects/var.png"
    repo="https://github.com/pbrowne011/understandingvar"
    tags="Finance,Python" >}}
A simulation of a VaR calculation for the BU Investment club portfolio using
the historical, variance-covariance, and Monte Carlo methods. This seems a bit
more relevant given the banking issues of the first few months of 2023...

{{< project 
    title="Turing House"
    image="/img/projects/turinghouse.gif"
    tags="Flask,Twilio,GPT-3,Java (Processing)" >}}
A hackathon project where our team built a 2D dungeon crawler game in Java
Processing. I built the backend, a Flask app that used the Twilio API to send
messages to the player as they advanced through the game, giving clues and
(hopefully) encouraging messages. I also built a chatbot interface to have a
conversation with the "ghost" of Alan Turing using the davinci-003 gpt model
from OpenAI.

Our team ended up winning the Twilio Award for our project!
