# What I'm working on

These are some of the projects I'm currently working on

## Systems Research

* Summer and Fall 2023
* Repository (private)

From our proposal: "Professor Appavoo and his research group have, for a long
time, been looking at ways to apply machine learning to predict the execution
of a computer... In this project, we hope to supplement and expand on this work
with a concrete data-driven study. In particular, we hope to quantify if and
how neural networks (or other appropriate machine learning mechanisms) can be
trained on low-level data of a systemâ€™s operation."

# What I've worked on

This is a list of some of the projects I've worked on in the past.

## DFA Simulator 

* June 2023
* [Repository](https://github.com/pbrowne011/dfa)

A program written in C that takes a defined .dfa file and an input string, and
returns whether that input string is accepted or not by the given dfa. I may
add NFA functionality to this as well at some point.

## Cubert

* February 2023
* [Repository](https://github.com/pbrowne011/cubert)

This is a project to implement different algorithms to solve a Rubik's cube,
each with a different definition of "efficiency". I implement a layered
algorithm approach, and am working on building an implementation of the
Thistlethwaite algorithm.

## VaR

* December 2022
* [Repository](https://github.com/pbrowne011/understandingvar)

Here I simulated a VaR calculation for the BU Investment club portfolio using
the historical, variance-covariance, and Monte Carlo methods. This seems a bit
more relevant given the banking issues of the first few months of 2023...

## Turing House

* November 2022
* [Repository](https://github.com/lakitu/turing-house)

A hackathon project where our team built a 2D dungeon crawler game in Java
Processing. I built the backend, a Flask app that used the Twilio API to send
messages to the player as they advanced through the game, giving clues and
(hopefully) encouraging messages. I also built a chatbot interface to have a
conversation with the "ghost" of Alan Turing using the davinci-003 gpt model
from OpenAI.

Our team ended up winning the Twilio Award for our project!
