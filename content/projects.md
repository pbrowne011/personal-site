# What I'm working on

These are some of the projects I'm currently working on

## Modeling the VIX

* Spring 2023
* [Repository](https://github.com/pbrowne011/vixproject)

A project in Python to model the Volatility Index (VIX) using the GARCH and ARIMA models, as well as neural nets.

## Cubert

* February 2023
* [Repository](https://github.com/pbrowne011/cubert)

This is a project to implement different algorithms to solve a Rubik's cube, each with a different definition of "efficiency". I implement a layered algorithm approach, and am working on building an implementation of the Thistlethwaite algorithm.

# What I've worked on

This is a list of some of the projects I've worked on in the past.

## VaR

* December 2022
* [Repository](https://github.com/pbrowne011/understandingvar)

Here I simulated a VaR calculation for the BU Investment club portfolio using the historical, variance-covariance, and Monte Carlo methods. This seems a bit more relevant given financial issues of the first few months of 2023...

## Turing House

* November 2022
* [Repository](https://github.com/lakitu/turing-house)

A hackathon project where our team built a 2D dungeon crawler game in Java Processing. I built the backend, a Flask app that used the Twilio API to send messages to the player as they advanced through the game, giving clues and (hopefully) encouraging messages. I also built a chatbot interface to have a conversation with the "ghost" of Alan Turing using the davinci-003 gpt model from OpenAI.

Our team ended up winning the Twilio Award for our project!

## HackHarvard

* October 2022
* Repository (now private)

My first project where I built a wiki page usind Django, as well as an AI chatbot with Flask.
