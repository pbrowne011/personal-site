<br>
Many general-purpose electronics kits include a few integrated circuits (ICs) in
addition to jumper wires, resistors, capacitors, and other electronic circuit
components. A common IC included in kits is the 74HC595N, often one manufactured
by Texas Instruments (SN74HC595N). After receiving a few of these in various
electronics kits, I built several circuits with this shift register to
understand how it works.<br><br>
<h2 id="background-on-integrated-circuits">Background on integrated circuits</h2>
<p>Circuits are made up of electrical components, such as resistors, capacitors,
transistors, and diodes. While all circuits can be made up of these components,
it is often necessary to combine several parts together into a single component,
where the parts are closer together, smaller, and merged into a single building
block. These circuits are typically etched onto a semiconductor material, such
as silicon, and are known as <strong>integrated circuits</strong>, or <strong>ICs</strong> for short.</p>
<p>The first IC (an oscillator) was created by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments
in 1958. Robert Noyce invented the first mass-producible IC, fabricating it
using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_process">planar process</a> and
silicon. IC construction exploded in well-documented fashion at companies such
as Fairchild Semiconductor, Intel, and AMD, with Silicon Valley earning its name
from the semiconductor material being used to produce these chips.</p>

</figure>
<p>Different IC families were developed in the 1960s. The first well-known family,
<strong>transistor-transistor logic</strong> (TTL), was most prevalent in the 1970s and
80s. Computers such as the PDP-11 (of UNIX and C fame) were built using TTL
integrated circuits, which derive their name from bipolar junction transistors
(BJTs) that perform the digital logic and output.</p>
<p>Later, modern IC development began with <strong>metal-oxide-semiconductor</strong> (MOS)
chips. MOS ICs rely on MOSFETs, transistors with high input impedance that draw
much less current than BJTs. While MOS circuits were lower power than TTL
circuits, they were not as fast, and didn&rsquo;t become the default option until
Moore&rsquo;s Law began to make them a more desirable option: as the size of MOSFET
transistors decreased, speed increased (and power consumption decreased), as
defined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling">Dennard scaling</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p><strong>Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor</strong> chips, or the CMOS family of ICs,
use multiple MOSFETs to invert signals. CMOS chips have several benefits for
circuits built from them: they draw even less power when not active, as one of
the MOFSETs is always off; they do not require pull-up or pull-down resistors to
set into a default state; and they are faster than MOS circuits because they can
switch more quickly between different states.</p>
<h3 id="reading-ic-device-numbers">Reading IC device numbers</h3>
<p>The device number on a chip&rsquo;s casing provides some information that doesn&rsquo;t
require reading the integrated circuit&rsquo;s datasheet. Texas Instruments has a
<a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ml/slyb236/slyb236.pdf">useful guide</a> to reading their
logic-device part numbers.</p>
<p>The <strong>SN74HC595N</strong> device number has five components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/iu922g/does_sn_prefix_on_ti_parts_mean_anything/"><em>SN</em></a>:
The standard prefix for TI logic components. The only alternative for this
type of logic chip (when purchasing from TI) is SNJ. These distinguish TI
circuits that are manufactured for military applications from other
circuits. Military-focused circuits are engineered to work more reliably, and
have larger ranges of operable temperatures (numbers often cited are 0 to 70
°C for commercial, -40 to 85 °C for industrial, -55 to 125 °C for
military). In TI&rsquo;s case, SNJ denotes that the circuit in question adheres to
the US military&rsquo;s specification for integrated circuits,
<a href="https://landandmaritimeapps.dla.mil/Downloads/MilSpec/Docs/MIL-PRF-38535/prf38535.pdf">MIL-PRF-38535</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400-series_integrated_circuits"><em>74</em></a>: This
refers to the logic family that our chip is part of. The other option for the
number (when considering the 595 circuit) is <em>54</em>, which is again used to
distinguish between military- and commercial-grade chips. The difference
between SNJ54 and SN54 is how the part is manufactured and distributed, and
you can <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/SN54HC595#order-quality">order either part from
TI</a>. The <em>64</em> prefix was
used for industrial ICs by TI for a short time. Today, it is active <a href="https://www.ti.com/sitesearch/en-us/docs/universalsearch.tsp?langPref=en-US&amp;nr=3&amp;searchTerm=SN64#q=SN64">for only
a few
parts</a>. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><br><br></p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_7400-series_integrated_circuits">7400 logic
series</a>
was originally introduced by Texas Instruments as a family of digital logic
ICs (as opposed to analog ICs). Other manufacturers make 7400-series chips
which perform identical functions under similar operating conditions. To
identify which chips perform identical functions across (and within)
manufacturers, you can remove manufacturer-specific information (the letters)
and compare the 7400-series part numbers. For example, Texas Instruments has
another IC, the <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/SN74LS595">SN74LS595N</a>, which
is identical in function (and shape) to the SN74HC595N, and ST&rsquo;s
<a href="https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/m74hc595.pdf">M74HC595</a> only differs
in specifications (and potentially quality - perhaps better, perhaps worse).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/an/szza036c/szza036c.pdf#15"><em>HC</em></a>: The &ldquo;family&rdquo;
prefix is a more specific indicator of which IC family (TTL, MOS, CMOS, etc.)
the circuit belongs to. Depending on how the circuit fits into a larger
system, you might choose a <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/SN74LS595">low-power
option</a> (<em>LS</em>), or <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/SN74AHC595">one with higher
speed</a> (<em>AHC</em>). In this case, <em>HC</em>
stands for &ldquo;high-speed CMOS logic&rdquo;. The IC uses complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, which provides the benefits of CMOS
circuits mentioned earlier when compared with other families like TTL. The
74HC595 also has a higher clock frequency than the same chip from other
families (e.g., the <em>LS</em> 595 family has a max. clock speed of 20MHz vs. the
HC&rsquo;s guaranteed maximum operating frequency of 29MHz at 6V (and 42MHz in ideal
conditions)).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_7400-series_integrated_circuits#:~:text=74x595"><em>595</em></a>:
The 7400-series has many different functions, each of which is specified by a
2- or 3-digit number. Each number has a unique description which specifies how
large the input/output of the circuit is, how many pins it has, what it does
generally (timer, oscillator, logic gate), and what it does
specifically. There are many types of multiplexers, for example, and each
family number distinguishes between them (e.g., the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_7400-series_integrated_circuits#:~:text=74x850">850</a>
is a &ldquo;1 of 16 data selector/multiplexer, clocked select&rdquo; while the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_7400-series_integrated_circuits#:~:text=74x851">851</a>
is a &ldquo;1 of 16 data selector/multiplexer&rdquo; with no clocked select). <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> The
short description of the 595 chip is an &ldquo;8-bit shift registers, serial-in,
parallel-out, output latches, output enable&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_electronic_component_packaging_types"><em>N</em></a>:
Texas Instruments uses the (in this case) last segment to describe the
packaging used. The SN74HC595N is enclosed in a plastic dual-in-line package
(PDIP), whose <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ml/mpdi002c/mpdi002c.pdf">specification</a>
describes important physical details about the integrated circuit (you can
also find the physical measurements on pg. 37 of the SN74HC595N manual). This
information is useful for, e.g., figuring out which footprint you should use
for the IC when designing a printed circuit board (PCB) for your system. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reading-the-datasheet">Reading the datasheet</h2>
<p>Reading datasheets is an important skill when designing circuits. While
tutorials and articles on the Internet are often useful, there are many ICs (and
other components) whose only documentation exists on the website of the company
that created them. Additionally, it is better to get specific information (like
timing intervals, operating temperatures and voltages) from the source rather
than secondhand.</p>
<p>Working with the 74HC595 is a good starting point. YouTube and other articles
online provide several toy examples that are useful in understanding it, but
many details exist only in the datasheet. For this post, I&rsquo;ll primarily use <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74hc595.pdf">the
datasheet</a> to explain the
SN74HC595N. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="description--features">Description &amp; Features</h3>
<p>The first page of the datasheet contains all of the details needed to understand
how the 74HC595 works at a high level. In the top right corner is a short
description of the circuit.</p>
<p><img src="/img/shiftreg/description.png" alt="Description of SN74HC595N from datasheet" width="50%"></p>
<p>Sometimes it takes a few passes to understand what the description is saying,
especially if you don&rsquo;t know what a shift register is or how a 3-state buffer
works.  Here, I&rsquo;ll go sentence-by-sentence to explain each detail, but after
awhile I should be able to understand at a glance what the part does, as well as
something about how it works. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>an 8-bit, serial-in, parallel-out shift register</em>: The general classification
of the 74595 is a <strong>register</strong>: it functions as memory, storing information
for later access. If you&rsquo;ve studied CPUs in any detail before, the word sounds
familiar: processors use processor registers to quickly store and read
information when performing machine instructions. Hardware registers are a
special type of memory: in addition to storing information, they also perform
some specific function. Here, the 74595 is a <strong>shift</strong> register: it stores 8
bits of information, and each time it receives a new bit of data, it shifts
its current data one spot to the right. This is equivalent to <code>&gt;&gt; 1</code>, bit wise
shifting right by 1 in C, or <code>SHR 1, %rax</code> in AT&amp;T syntax x86 assembly.<br><br></p>
<p>Shift registers can have serial and parallel inputs and outputs, which leads
to four types of shift registers: serial-in, serial-out (SISO), <strong>serial-in,
parallel-out (SIPO)</strong>, parallel-in, serial-out (PISO), and parallel-in,
parallel-out (PIPO). Serial data is sent one bit at a time over a single line
of communication: hence, a register with serial input has only one data input
pin. Parallel data is sent at the same time across multiple pins. Since the
74595 is an 8-bit register, it has 8 parallel outputs, plus a 9th output used
to add more shift registers (known as &ldquo;daisy-chaining&rdquo;).</p>
</li>
</ul>

register.<br>Source: Wikimedia Commons</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>feeds an 8-bit D-type storage register</em>: At the transistor level, memory is
stored in <strong>flip-flops</strong> and latches. The main difference between the two is
that flip-flop state changes are triggered by a clock signal, while latch
changes are asynchronous and can change state at any time. A <strong>D-type (data)
flip-flop</strong> has one input, and its output matches the input on each clock
edge.<br><br></p>
<p>The distinction implies that our shift register is actually made up of two
registers: a shift register to hold and shift input values, and a storage
register to hold output values. The shift and output registers form a
pipeline, and a clock is used to trigger the output register&rsquo;s outputs.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<figcaption><em>A D flip flop (4 NAND gates, 1 NOT gate)<br>Source: Wikimedia
Commons</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Separate clocks are provided for both the shift and storage register</em>: A
clock exists for the storage register. It uses D flip-flops, which are
controlled by a clock and allow. Why does a separate clock exist for the shift
register?<br><br></p>
<p>Consider the following question: when should the shift register shift its
input? The shift register could shift on every input, but suppose it get a
string of low inputs. How does it know to track a distinct low input? Tracking
inputs requires some mechanism (a clock) to &ldquo;tick&rdquo; every time it records a new
input state and shifts its current state over by 1 bit to make room.<br><br></p>
<p>This clock is distinct from the clock to output data to allow time for data to
flow from the shift register to the storage register and ensure stable
data. Distinct clocks also give the circuit designer finer control over how
the IC is used. However, the data sheet also mentions (on pg. 6) that the
clocks can be tied together - if they are, the shift register is always one
clock pulse ahead of the storage register.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The storage register has parallel 3-state outputs</em>: Another logic component
in digital circuits is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429052914/http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/sum2003/cmsc311/Notes/CompOrg/tristate.html"><strong>tri-state
buffer</strong></a>
(or three-state buffer). This buffer has two inputs and one output. Normally,
the output buffer would have two possible states: high (1) or low (0),
dictated by its input. However, a tri-state buffer&rsquo;s second input triggers a
third state: <strong>high impedence</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>When the output-enable (OE) input is high, the outputs are in the
high-impedance state</em>: Normally, it might be preferred to just display whatever output
is stored in the register. If the second input (called <strong>output enable</strong>,
or OE, by Texas Instruments) of the tri-state buffer is low, this is what
happens. When OE is set high, a valve is turned off, and the output doesn&rsquo;t
have enough current to register anything. The current is <em>impeded</em> by the
output enable being set high, regardless of whether the current is low or
high.<br><br></p>
<p>The notes linked above use a helpful analogy: imagine that high current is one
color (red), low current is another color (black), and no current is no
color. When the OE pin is set low, the output buffer displays the input pin&rsquo;s
color. The circuit is complete, and the color &ldquo;flows through&rdquo;. When the OE pin
is high, the valve is closed, the output buffer is blocked, and no color can
flow through.<br><br></p>
<p>One use case of tri-state buffers is when writing output to a bus. The
high-impedence state provides control over what data makes it onto the bus,
and what data is blocked from the bus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The shift register has a direct overriding clear (SRCLR) input, serial (SER)
input, and serial outputs for cascading</em>: Above, I&rsquo;ve already covered four of
the 74595&rsquo;s input pins. The serial input (SER) is used to provide input data
to the register. The serial clock (SRCLK) is the clock that triggers when the
shift register shifts and accepts a new input. The storage register clock
(RCLK) updates the output register. The output enable (OE), when high,
cuts off any output current from the output register. The fifth pin, mentioned
here, is the <strong>direct overriding clear (SRCLR)</strong>, which overrides all current
register values and sets them low.<br><br></p>
<p>The phrase also mentions a new feature: <em>serial outputs for cascading</em>. From
the first sentence of the description, it is known that the register produces
an 8-bit parallel output; however, I mentioned that a 9th existed. This output
pin is a serial line that outputs the last bit of the shift register, the one
being bumped off. It can be connected to the serial input pin of, say, another
shift register to allow for outputs longer than 8 or 9 bits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first page of the datasheet also contains a number of features. Several of
these are part of the description, but others provide specific measurements and
capabilities that help characterize this implementation of the 595 shift
register. These features range from operating specifications (&ldquo;Wide operating
voltage range of 2 V to 6 V&rdquo;, &ldquo;Low input current: 1 μA (maximum)&quot;) to output
capabilities. One notable feature is that &ldquo;High-current 3-state outputs can drive
up to 15 LSTTL loads&rdquo;. Translated, each output pin can provide enough current to
drive multiple low-powered TTL devices, a feature especially useful in larger
circuits.</p>
<p>The circuits built later in this post use LEDs, so it&rsquo;s important to note the
output current drive (&ldquo;±6-mA output drive at 5 V&rdquo;) and use the correct resistors
to match (something I did not do at first).</p>
<h3 id="pin-configuration">Pin configuration</h3>
<p>Often, the pin configuration is the first section of a datasheet that you&rsquo;ll
look at. For example: you have an <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74as1008a.pdf">8-bit AND
gate</a> and want to know which
pins connect to power (VCC) and ground (GND), and where the inputs and outputs
are. The function of the IC is not a mystery, but where to hook up the wires is.</p>
<p><img src="/img/shiftreg/pinout.png" alt="Pin output of SN74HC595N" width="75%"></p>
<p>Two pin configurations are shown. The package of the 74HC595N (the last letter
of the IC&rsquo;s name), determines whether to use the 2-row rectangular diagram or
the 20-pin square (e.g., a SN74HC595FK).</p>
<p>Since the SN74HC595N is a PDIP package, the left diagram is relevant. On the IC,
there are the five input pins, nine output pins ($\text{Q}_A$ through
$\text{Q}_H$, plus the serial output pin $\text{Q}_H'$), and connections to
power and ground. Pins 1 and 16 are located next to the side indent in the chip.</p>
<h3 id="block-diagram">Block diagram</h3>
<p>Page 11 of the datasheet has an enlarged view of the functional block diagram
from the first page.</p>
<p><img src="/img/shiftreg/block-diagram.png" alt="Block diagram of SN74HC595N" width="80%"></p>
<p>Integrated circuits are themselves typically made up of smaller components, such
as logic gates and flip flops. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_block_diagram"><strong>Functional block
diagrams</strong></a> model the
system as a whole by abstracting each smaller component into a symbol. In this
diagram, the three main areas detailed (from left to right) are the shift
register, the storage register, and the tri-state bus. The diagram breaks up
each of these components into its sub components: the shift register is made up
of mostly dual D-type flip-flops, the storage register is D-type flip-flops, and
the tri-state bus is tri-state buffers.</p>
<p>A block diagram can be thought of as a logical schematic: it abstracts away the
electrical components to focus on how information flows through the system. What
happens when the serial clear pin is set high? What components are updated by
the register clock?</p>
<p>In the block diagram above, let&rsquo;s examine the first row.</p>
<p><img src="/img/shiftreg/toprow.png" alt="Top row of block diagram" width="95%"></p>
<p>The first row contains two D-type flip-flops storing one bit each. The first
flip-flop is one of the eight bits stored by the shift register, while the
second is the first of eight bits stored by the storage register. The triangle
on the right represents a tri-state buffer. This is distinct from the four
triangles for the first four inputs (OE, RCLK, SRCLR, and SRCLK), which
represent NOT gates.</p>
<p>The three inputs to the first flip-flop are SER (serial input - the main data
line), SRCLK (the clock for the shift register), and SRCLR (the signal to reset
the register). The empty circles represent NOT gates for bit inversions, while
the filled-in circles represent connection points where signals meet and
branch. Inside of the two D-type flip-flops, there is a triangle, which
signifies that the clock is edge-triggered. See <a href="/posts/shiftreg1#timing-diagram">&ldquo;Timing
Diagrams&rdquo;</a> for why both flip-flops are positive
edge-triggered.</p>
<p><img src="/img/shiftreg/d-flip-flop.png" alt="Close up of four flip-flops" width="40%"></p>
<p>Inside of each flip-flop, the inputs are labeled. The letters represent the type
of signal sent.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>C</strong>: clock input</li>
<li><strong>D</strong>: data input</li>
<li><strong>R</strong>: reset input</li>
<li><strong>S</strong>: set input (complement to reset)</li>
</ul>
<p>The numbers represent the
<a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/digital/chpt-12/introduction-to-shift-registers/"><strong>stages</strong></a>
of the shift register. Shift registers are sequential - you shift one bit at a
time, in a given ordering (0 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 2 &hellip;). Each flip-flop and tri-state buffer
represents a stage in the sequential process, depending on where it is located
in the circuit. The textbook at the link above has a good explanation of how a
four stage shift register works, and how each stage interacts with the stage
before it and the one after.</p>
<p>The 74HC595 has three main stages shown in the diagram: the <strong>input stage
(1D)</strong>, the <strong>subsequent shift register stages (2D)</strong>, and the <strong>storage
register stage (3R/3S)</strong>. The datasheet describes how the stages link to the
possible functions of the shift register:</p>
<p><img src="/img/shiftreg/function-table.png" alt="Function table of shift register" width="90%"></p>
<p>The first stage always takes input from SER, while every other stage takes its
input from the previous stage. The subsequent bits are all treated as one stage
(2D, 3S/3R) because they all function identically in shifting data forward.</p>
<p>Note how <strong>R</strong> has no number next to it - reset is a control signal that affects
all stages immediately (not sequentially). Note that SRCLR affects all bits in
the shift register simultaneously, but not the storage register; hence the
storage register is updated sequentially (when RCLK triggers).</p>
<p>To set the first bit of output for the shift register as a 1, we first set SER
and SRCLR high. The bar over SRCLR indicates that by setting SRCLR high, we are
performing the inverse action: high for normal operation, low for clear. After
setting SER and SRCLR high, we next pulse the SRCLK pin (set to high, then
low). The clock impulse is triggered on the transition from low to high
(positive edge), capturing the input data and updating the flip-flop&rsquo;s
output. <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<p>To send the bit in the first D flip-flop of our shift register to the
corresponding output pin ($\text{Q}_A$), we first set OE (output enable) to
active low. The bar above OE indicates that when we set it to low, the current
goes high into the tri-state buffer and allows the output through with no
impedance. The output is triggered by transitioning RCLK from low to active
high, and with OE low, the output value now appears at the pin $\text{Q}_A$.</p>
<h3 id="timing-diagram">Timing diagram</h3>
<p>When manipulating a shift register at human speeds, the timing specification is
less relevant - we operate at the scale of seconds and tens or hundreds of
milliseconds ($10^{-3}$ s), not nanoseconds ($10^{-9}$ s). However, shift
registers are often used in conjunction with other integrated circuits that
operate much faster: CPUs.</p>
<p>The guaranteed maximum operating frequency of the SN74HC595 is 29 MHz, while
under normal laboratory conditions ($\text{T}_{\text{A}}$) it operates at 42
MHz. This is slower than many microcontrollers <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, such as the STM32F446 used
later (with a CPU frequency <a href="https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32f446re.pdf">up to 180
MHz</a>, and an I/O
frequency up to 90 MHz). Many modern CPUs also operate at a much faster speed,
retiring more than one instruction per nanosecond. The difference in operating
frequencies matters when putting together a system comprised of different ICs,
such as <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slva704/slva704.pdf">an I2C bus</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/shiftreg/timing-diagram.png" width="70%"
alt="Timing diagram of each pin for shift register"></p>
<p>The timing diagram above illustrates the timing and switching durations in an
abstracted format, similar to how the block diagram abstracts away the internal
circuitry to leave functional components. <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> You can watch the single bit of
input get shifted right to each output register as time increases (as you move
right).</p>
<p>You might notice that the shift register clock (SRCLK) and storage register
clock (RCLK) alternate between pulses. The diagram provides a logical structure
to the input and output transitions - it doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the waveforms
shown are precisely how those clocks work during operation. It illustrates what
was mentioned in the previous section - the inputs and outputs are
<strong>positive-edge triggered</strong>. More explicitly, in Section 8.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both the shift register clock (SRCLK) and storage register clock (RCLK) are
positive-edge triggered. If both clocks are connected together, the shift
register always is one clock pulse ahead of the storage register.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Positive-edge triggered means that the output changes as the clock transitions
from low to high (the &ldquo;positive edge&rdquo; of the waveform). You can see that the
first time RCLK goes high, the output appears on the output pin $\text{Q}_A$.</p>
<p>Note from the table in section 6.6 how the minimum timing requirements get lower
as the operating voltage increases.</p>
<p><img src="/img/shiftreg/timing-table.png" width="70%"
alt="Timing table showing time decrease as voltage increases for CLK pins"></p>
<p>When a current is switched from high to low, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave#Characteristics_of_imperfect_square_waves">the waveform is not square or
immediate</a>.
In reality, switching from high to low is on a spectrum, depending on
characteristics such as signal dampening, the materials used, and other
considerations. As you improve this transformation, your waveform improves and
becomes more square. Increasing the voltage supplied to the shift register
forces the signal to settle faster, and therefore the time requirements to wait
for the transition are lower.</p>

<p>There are two separate sections concerned with timing - &ldquo;Timing Requirements&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Switching Characteristics&rdquo;. The two are related, but measure different
things. Timing refers to <strong>how long a pulse must last</strong> (at a minimum) before
another signal can be sent. Switching refers to <strong>the duration between a change
in an input signal and the change in the corresponding output signal</strong>.</p>
<p>A good example of <em>switching</em> is what happens when output enable (OE) is
transitioned from active low to high. From what we learned earlier, a positive
transition in OE activates a high-impedence state, preventing any signal from
being sent by the register&rsquo;s output pins. Based on the datasheet, there are
three times associated with OE being triggered:</p>
<ul>
<li>$\text{t}_\text{en}$ (50 pF): enabling OE (low -&gt; high)</li>
<li>$\text{t}_\text{dis}$ (50 pF): disabling OE (high -&gt; low)</li>
<li>$\text{t}_\text{en}$ (150 pF): enabling OE (low -&gt; high at higher capacitance)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first $\text{t}_\text{en}$ has a &ldquo;typical&rdquo; switching time of 13 ns and a max
switching time of 26 ns. It will take <strong>at most</strong> 26 nanoseconds for the output
pins to enter a state of high impedence from when the OE pin crosses the 50%
threshold from low to high ($\text{t}_\text{PLZ}$/$\text{t}_\text{PHZ}$ in the
diagram below).</p>
<p><img src="/img/shiftreg/oe-waveform.png" width="70%"
alt="Waveform for output enable pin with timing"></p>
<p>The diagram above is the waveform for the tri-state buffer abstracted away by
the timing diagram. It is still an abstraction (the signal does not travel in
straight lines), but it is more accurate. It provides timing information for
triggering the output enable (OE) pin.</p>
<p>The first waveform is for OE. The pin starts at high (a state of impedance),
transitions to low, then back to high. The other two waveforms represent output
pins. Waveform 1 is when the output pin is supposed to be active low
($\text{V}_\text{OL}$). It starts in an unknown state (hence the $\approx$
symbol next to $\text{V}_\text{CC}$), transitions to its expected state when
enabled, then goes back to an unknown state of impedance. You can see the times
clearly indicated by the distance between dashed lines - each dashed line is
when one of the waveforms reaches the 50% mark on the waveform, the transition
point.</p>
<h3 id="specifications">Specifications</h3>
<p>This is arguably the most important section when it comes to designing a circuit
that uses an IC. However, I will wait until <strong>Part 2</strong> to cover this in more
depth.</p>
<h2 id="first-circuit-16-led">First circuit: 16-LED</h2>
<p>I built my first circuit with no microcontroller - just human inputs.</p>
<p><img src="/img/shiftreg/circuit/circuit.jpg" alt="Image of first circuit"
width="75%"></p>
<p>In the bottom left corner are five buttons with corresponding LEDs. <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Each
button controls one of the five inputs to the shift registers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #FFFFFF; text-shadow: 0 0 2px #000;">White:</span> SER</strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #FF3333;">Red:</span> OE</strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #33FF33;">Green:</span> RCLK</strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #3333FF;">Blue:</span> SRCLK</strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #FFFF33; text-shadow: 0 0 2px #000;">Yellow:</span>
SRCLR</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Four of them are tied to ground, but the button on the right (SRCLR) is tied to
power. Since SRCLR is inverted, we only want it to go high when clearing the
registers. If it was not inverted, we would hold it low, like the other inputs,
but because of the inversion we hold it high.</p>
<p>The blue wires connect the input to the first shift register, and the green
wires connect the output from the register to the first eight output LEDs
(white). The inputs are tied into the second shift register through flat jumper
wires (some above, some below), and that register&rsquo;s outputs are connected to the
green LEDs through the yellow jumper wires.</p>
<p>To turn the first LED on (output $\text{Q}_A$), SRCLK must register while SER is
on. In terms of pressing buttons, this corresponds to holding the white LED
while pressing the blue LED. The shift register is triggered on the press of the
button, not its release. To send the to the output LEDs, RCLK (green) is
pressed.</p>

<p>To shift the output right, we can send a series of SRCLK inputs while SER is not
pressed, shifting the &lsquo;1&rsquo; bit over a few places. The display is triggered by
pressing RCLK again.</p>

<p>By default, OE is low. Since it is inverted (the bar over OE), it is always
high, allowing output through the tri-state buffer unimpeded. Pressing the red
button sets OE to high and puts the outputs in a state of high impedance.</p>

<p>To clear the register, press the SRCLR button (yellow) and then RCLK. SRCLK
doesn&rsquo;t need to be triggered - the SRCLR input is unphased and clears the shift
register immediately.</p>

<h2 id="using-an-mcu">Using an MCU</h2>
<p>One way to maximize the potential of the above circuit is to send inputs faster
using microcontroller units (MCUs). I next used an Arduino Uno (ELEGOO, with an
ATMega328P processor) to count on a seven-segment display, and an STM32F446 to
control the LEDs in the circuit above.</p>
<h3 id="schematic-with-arduino-uno">Schematic with Arduino Uno</h3>
<p>Adding a microcontroller into the circuit isn&rsquo;t difficult. The schematic below
shows how adding an Arduino Uno to a circuit with one shift register requires
tying three data output pins to control the serial input and both clocks. The
other two inputs (SRCLR, OE) are connected to their respective defaults.</p>

<p>Online, one program people often write using shift registers is counting to
$2^{16}\space (65536)$. I decided instead to count to 16 using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display">seven-segment

<p>You can the full circuit at 0:12 in the video. The UNO controls power and
ground, the black and red wires at the bottom. It also controls the clock inputs
(RCLK, SRCLK) using the output ports connected with the long white and black
wires, and the input with the red wire. Output from the SN74HC595N is sent
through registers and ends up at the display.</p>
<p>Normally, this display would require eight GPIO pins from the Arduino; however,
using the SN74HC595N, we only needed three. This is the main reason this IC is
included in beginner&rsquo;s electronic kits. People often start by lighting up LEDs
when using MCUs; &ldquo;Blinky&rdquo; is the &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; in this way. Shift registers
provide a convenient way to blink many LEDs while using less IO ports.</p>
<h3 id="circuit-3-16-led-with-stm32">Circuit 3: 16-LED with STM32</h3>
<p>One program I saw others do that looked fun was bouncing a pulse through the
LEDs as a wave. Another was to use PWM (pulse width modulation) to control how
bright the LEDs shone. I combined these two into one program running on a Nucleo
board (STM32F4 processor).</p>

<p>I used STM32CubeIDE&rsquo;s HAL (hardware abstraction layer) to write the program;

</code></pre></div><p>One thing you&rsquo;ll notice in the videos above is how bright the LEDs are. This is
because I used the wrong resistors. $220\space\Omega$ resistors are typically
used when considering the forward voltage of an LED, but the shift register has
maximum ratings in the specification that the LED exceeds with this
resistor. <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>
<div style="text-align: center">$V = IR$</div>
<p>To get the correct resistance required, we can apply Ohm&rsquo;s law. With a
$220\space\Omega$ resistor, and assuming a $2\space\text{V}$ drop per LED, each
LED draws $(5 - 2)/220 = 13.6\space\text{mA}$ of current. With $8$ LEDs, this
adds up to $109.1\space\text{mA}$ of current, well above the maximum output
rating of $70\space\text{mA}$ for the SN74HC595N.</p>
<p>Using a $1\text{K}\space\Omega$ resistor, we can lower the current draw to
$24\space\text{mA}$, enough to light each LED but not so much that the register
burns out.</p>
<p>I quickly added stronger resistors ($1\text{K}\space\Omega$) to reduce the
current draw of the LEDs and avoid burning out the shift registers; however,
none of the circuits that used those resistors</p>

<p>This section will soon include <strong>Part 2</strong> of this post. In that, I will go into
sections of the datasheet I haven&rsquo;t covered yet, such as the specifications,
&ldquo;typical characteristics&rdquo; graph, and application layout information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also build more circuits: one uses only one GPIO output port for data
(instead of three), and another will output data onto a bus using a shift
register.</p>
<p>This post was meant as an introduction to reading datasheets, understanding
shift registers, and building circuits with it.The purpose of the second post is
to solve the mystery: what exactly <em>are</em> the applications of the 74HC595N in
systems today? How is it used in the devices below?</p>

<p>When designing circuits on KiCAD, it took me a minute to realize that I
wanted the package sizing information, not the IC-specific information for
pins (what matters is where they&rsquo;re located on the PCB, not what they
do). One important point to make is that the &ldquo;Device Information&rdquo; size given
is nominal - the physical footprint size is what matters.  <img
src="/img/shiftreg/pdip.png" alt="PDIP packaging" width="65%"> If you look
closely at the diagram, you&rsquo;ll notice that the nominal width from the
datasheet (6.35 mm) is different from the actual width (7.94 mm). Both are
taken by averaging the range provided. When designing a PCB, use the actual
size so that the part fits into the holes properly.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>The principle of relying on primary sources does not apply solely to
datasheets. When writing software, past a certain point, <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#rtfm">one needs to learn
to use the resources
available</a>; however,
<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/">there are many ways to do
this</a>. Asking questions and learning
things on your own is a skill that requires practice.<br><br> At first, I
was going to go on a tangent about how telling someone &ldquo;RTFM&rdquo; is the kindest
thing you can do for them. While I do believe this to some extent, I have
come to understand that reading the manual requires someone understanding of
the software/program/device in question first, which comes from experience,
textbooks, guides, and others. People need to be able to learn how to help
themselves when solving their own problems. However, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense
to tell someone to read the <code>man</code> page on <code>ls</code> if they don&rsquo;t know what a
<code>man</code> page is, or <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/answer-questions-well/#point-them-to-the-documentation">to &ldquo;read the documentation&rdquo; without providing
documentation that answers the
question</a>.<br><br>
I don&rsquo;t understand much about integrated circuits, but spending more time
than necessary reading the datasheet has taught me more than just how to
fan output to multiple LEDs with the 74HC595N.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

below the minimum guaranteed operating frequency of the SN74HC595. By
default, the processor runs at 1 MHz - even slower than the shift
register. None of these measurements take into account the difference
between CPU and I/O pin frequency, either.&#160;<a href="#fnref:7" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
