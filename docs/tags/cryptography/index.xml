      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cryptographic protocols that perform computations on encrypted data without
decrypting it are known as homomorphic encryption. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption#Fully_homomorphic_encryption&#34;&gt;Fully homomorphic
encryption&lt;/a&gt;
(FHE) protocols, systems which support arbitrary computations, often rely on
different primitives than conventional cryptography systems. Most FHE systems in
practice used lattice-based cryptography, relying on a computational hardness
assumption known as the learning with errors (LWE) problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the 20th century, cryptography did not rely on a formalized system of
provable security. Rather, one set of people (cryptographers) would come up with
clever ciphers, and another set of people (cryptanalysts) would attempt to break
those ciphers. Encryption schemes such as the Caesar cipher, the Vingenère
cipher, the Enigma, and other systems were not formally proven secure by
cryptographers. Rather, they relied on obfuscation and statistical properties
that made deciphering messages fairly difficult. However, each one of these
systems had some sort of flaw that cryptanalysts were able to exploit to
decipher encrypted messages. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
