      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working through some of the exercises from &amp;ldquo;The C Programming Language&amp;rdquo; by Kernighan and Ritchie, and ran into an issue in Chapter 2 (&amp;ldquo;Types, Operators, and Expressions&amp;rdquo;).
Exercise 2-7:
 Write a function invert(x,p,n) that returns x with the n bits that begin at position p inverted (i.e., 1 changed into 0 and vice versa), leaving the others unchanged.
 This seemed easy enough, and I wrote the following function as a solution: 1
/* invert.c */ unsigned int invert(unsigned x, int p, int n) { unsigned mask = ~(~0 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; n) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; p-(n-1); return x ^ mask; } Earlier, the authors wrote a similar function get_bits(x,p,n), and stated some assumptions they made when writing it:
 We assume that bit position 0 is at the right end and that n and p are sensible positive values.
 Originally, I thought &amp;ldquo;sensible positive values&amp;rdquo; implied maximum and minimum bounds on p and n:
 n &amp;gt; 0, and p &amp;gt;= 0: it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to have n=0 (what&amp;rsquo;s the point of inverting 0 bits?), and setting p or n to a negative value has no meaning in the context of absolute position or size.</description>
