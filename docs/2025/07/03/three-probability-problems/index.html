			<p>Yesterday, I <a href="2025/07/02/lognormal">tried</a> (and failed) to derive both the
density function and the median of the lognormal distribution. I added these
facts to my Anki deck when reviewing an older formula sheet, but broke the first
rule of a good memory practice: do not learn if you do not understand.</p>
<p>There are many other skeletons in this closet (what of the gamma distribution,
when I don&rsquo;t remember much about the gamma function outside of
factorials?). Instead of rooting them all out, I gave myself a quick test this
afternoon. How much probability do I understand?</p>
<p>I selected three problems from William Feller&rsquo;s probability textbook, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2378167.An_Introduction_to_Probability_Theory_and_Its_Applications_Volume_1">&ldquo;An
Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications&rdquo;, Volume
1</a>. They
were arbitrary, but all questions I could have answered somewhat easily when
studying the subject actively.</p>
<h4 id="question-1-chapter-iv-combination-of-events">Question 1 (Chapter IV, &ldquo;Combination of Events&rdquo;)</h4>
<blockquote>
<ol start="7">
<li><em>Quadruples in a bridge hand</em>.  By a quadruple we shall understand four
cards of the same face value, so that a bridge hand of thirteen cards may
contain $0, 1, 2,$ or $3$ quadruples.  Calculate the corresponding
probabilities.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Things that went well:</p>
<ul>
<li>I understood the problem well. Card-counting problems are common when learning
to count, so I may be evaluating how well that heuristic worked, rather than
my ability to count combinations of a different event.</li>
<li>I remembered the difference between permutations and combination (after a
couple of moments), and how to count different events when order matters and
when it does not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Things that did not go well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counting problems rely on attention to detail. I did not realize until the end
(just before I looked at the answer) that there were $13$, not $12$ cards in a
hand. This affects, for instance, how many ways one can get a hand of three
quads: in addition to the three sets, there&rsquo;s an extra card to be accounted
for.</li>
<li>It took me a second to remember why there are $\binom{52}{13}$ possible hands
when dealing a deck of cards to four people. I got stuck on why $52!$ is in
the numerator - aren&rsquo;t there only $13$ cards being dealt? - but eventually
remembered what was in the denominator as well ($39!$).</li>
</ul>
<p>I got all answers to this question correct except $\Pr(X=1)$, <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> where I
didn&rsquo;t pay attention to detail and only accounted for $12$ of the $13$
cards. I also decided to subtract the probabilities of $1$ quad and $2$ quads by
the higher-numbered probabilities, but can&rsquo;t remember if I discarded that before
peeking at the key. The correct answers (as written by Feller) are:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Let } p^{-1}=\binom{52}{13}\text{.  Then} \\[1.5ex]
\Pr(X=3) &amp;= 40 \cdot \binom{13}{3} \cdot p \\[1.5ex]
\Pr(X=2) &amp;= \binom{44}{5} \cdot \binom{13}{2} \cdot p \\[1.5ex]
\Pr(X=1) &amp;= \binom{48}{9} \cdot 13 \cdot p \\[1.5ex]
\Pr(X=0) &amp;= 1 - \sum_{x=1}^{3}\;\Pr(X=x)
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>Overall, I didn&rsquo;t fare too well here. I need to relearn how to count (and
practice it much more). I have Anki cards for permutations and combinations,
but some card additions that might help include</p>
<ul>
<li>giving a count and asking me to explain it to myself</li>
<li>giving a permutation and asking for its combination (and vice versa)</li>
<li>giving a count and adding a twist (given probability of three quads, what&rsquo;s
the probability of four triples?)</li>
</ul>
<p>A better strategy would be to read through the chapters on combinatorics and
conditional probability in several passes, pulling out understanding from each
pass to build intuition. It will be a good sign when I don&rsquo;t question myself on
why the number of potential hands is $\binom{52}{13}$. Not sure what I&rsquo;ll do
yet, but I&rsquo;ll keep this in mind as I encounter more of this type of Anki card.</p>
<h4 id="question-2-chapter-ix-random-variables">Question 2 (Chapter IX, &ldquo;Random Variables&rdquo;)</h4>
<blockquote>
<ol start="17">
<li><em>Birthdays</em>.  For a group of $n$ people find the expected number of days
of the year which are birthdays of exactly $k$ people.  (Assume $365$ days
and that all arrangements are equally probable.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Ah, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">birthday paradox</a></em> he
exclaimed! as I proceeded to blunder through this problem. Again relying on
pattern matching, I remembered that there was something unique in the birthday
paradox, but couldn&rsquo;t remember what that thing <em>was</em>. I also misunderstood the
problem, as the birthday paradox asks about the case where $k \geq 2$.</p>
<p>Reeling, I considered the binomial distribution: we&rsquo;re given variables with the
names $n$ and $k$, and there&rsquo;s a $p$ ($\frac{1}{365}$). Applying this intuition,
I came up with
$$
P(X=k)=p^k(1-p)^{n-k}
$$
however, as the astute might notice, this is not the probability mass function
of the binomial distribution. That is instead
$$
P(X=k)=\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}
$$
which includes an actual binomial term to account for the ways in which these
events can be ordered. Counting matters quite a bit in probability.</p>
<p>In the end the correct answer (again, courtesy of Feller) is
$$
\binom{n}{k}364^{n-k}365^{1-n}
$$</p>
<p>Evaluating what I had originally (and adding the binomial term),
$$
\begin{align}
&amp;= \binom{n}{k}\left(\frac{1}{365}\right)^k\left(1-\frac{1}{365}\right)^{n-k} \\
&amp;= \binom{n}{k}\frac{1^k \cdot 364^{n-k}}{365^k \cdot 365^{n-k}} \\
&amp;= \binom{n}{k}364^{n-k} \cdot 365^{-n} \\
\end{align}
$$
I&rsquo;m missing $365$ in the numerator. I did not account for another part of this
problem: we are not calculating a probability, rather,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the <em>expected number of days</em> of the year&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(strike two from the first problem, attention to detail)</p>
<p>Since this is an expectation, we multiply each day by its probability and sum
the days up. In mathematical terms,
$$
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[X] &amp;= \sum_{x=1}^{365}\;1 \cdot \Pr(X=x) \\[1.2ex]
&amp;= 365 \cdot \Pr(X=x)
\end{align}
$$
giving us the missing $365$ from above.</p>
<p>Overall, not great: making the same mistakes, relying on pattern recognition
rather than intuition, not understanding the question.</p>
<h4 id="question-3-chapter-ix">Question 3 (Chapter IX)</h4>
<blockquote>
<ol start="21">
<li>Find the covariance of the number of ones and sixes in <em>n</em> throws of a
die.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I did not give this problem a full effort. I saw the term <em>covariance</em>,
attempted to recall the formula from memory, and gave up when I could not.</p>
<p>This problem attacked another area of probability (properties of random
variables) that I studied but can no longer recall. It wasn&rsquo;t too hard to answer
this with the formula for covariance in front of me: $\mathbb{E}[XY] - \mu_x
\mu_y = 0 - \frac{n}{6\; \cdot \;6} = -\frac{n}{36}$ (the throws are assumed
to be independent). My unfamiliarity with covariance is once again not great.</p>
<h3 id="what-have-i-learned-what-do-i-understand">What have I learned? What do I understand?</h3>
<p>While answering these questions, I felt like someone returning to a place they
hadn&rsquo;t been to in awhile. Though it&rsquo;s only been six months since my last class
in statistics, the gaps in my knowledge have grown and eaten through much of the
intuition I used to have. Twelve months ago these problems would have been much
easier than they were today.</p>
<p>This indicated the same fundamental issue: I have <em>learned</em>, but it is clear I
no longer <em>understand</em>. I can tell you that $\text{Var}[X] = \mathbb{E}[X^2] -
\mathbb{E}[X]^2$, but if asked follow-up questions, there would be significant
gaps in my knowledge that come up.</p>
<p>Where do I go from here? Do I attempt to relearn probability from the ground up,
or take my half-built crooked tower of knowledge with me as I go? Or is the
choice binary?</p>
<p>The key point is that I now have an <em>explicit</em> choice. I know where my knowledge
stands currently better than if I kept going through Anki cards sporadically and
haphazardly. As a result, I can be more intentional about my memory practice and
what I choose to learn in general. I&rsquo;ll consider tradeoffs with, e.g.,
technologies I need to know for work, but now I know better what
I&hellip; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_competence">know</a>.</p>

<p>Aside: I am undecided on what to use for $\LaTeX$ probability
notation. When writing, I often use $P$ and $\Pr$, but prefer
$\mathbb{P}\text{r}$ (without the double line in the bend of the P). I
haven&rsquo;t found a symbol for that P yet and would want to turn it into an
Emacs/$\LaTeX$ macro as well if it&rsquo;s complex.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
