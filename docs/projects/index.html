DFA Simulator June 2023 Repository A program written in C that takes a defined .dfa file and an input string, and returns whether that input string is accepted or not by the given dfa. I may add NFA functionality to this as well at some point.
Cubert February 2023 Repository This is a project to implement different algorithms to solve a Rubik&rsquo;s cube, each with a different definition of &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo;." />

<p>These are some of the projects I&rsquo;m currently working on</p>
<h2 id="systems-research">Systems Research</h2>
<ul>
<li>Summer and Fall 2023</li>
<li>Repository (private)</li>
</ul>
<p>From our proposal: &ldquo;Professor Appavoo and his research group have, for a long
time, been looking at ways to apply machine learning to predict the execution
of a computer&hellip; In this project, we hope to supplement and expand on this work
with a concrete data-driven study. In particular, we hope to quantify if and
how neural networks (or other appropriate machine learning mechanisms) can be
trained on low-level data of a system’s operation.&rdquo;</p>
<h1 id="what-ive-worked-on">What I&rsquo;ve worked on</h1>
<p>This is a list of some of the projects I&rsquo;ve worked on in the past.</p>
<h2 id="dfa-simulator">DFA Simulator</h2>
<ul>
<li>June 2023</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pbrowne011/dfa">Repository</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A program written in C that takes a defined .dfa file and an input string, and
returns whether that input string is accepted or not by the given dfa. I may
add NFA functionality to this as well at some point.</p>
<h2 id="cubert">Cubert</h2>
<ul>
<li>February 2023</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pbrowne011/cubert">Repository</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a project to implement different algorithms to solve a Rubik&rsquo;s cube,
each with a different definition of &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo;. I implement a layered
algorithm approach, and am working on building an implementation of the
Thistlethwaite algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="var">VaR</h2>
<ul>
<li>December 2022</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pbrowne011/understandingvar">Repository</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here I simulated a VaR calculation for the BU Investment club portfolio using
the historical, variance-covariance, and Monte Carlo methods. This seems a bit
more relevant given the banking issues of the first few months of 2023&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="turing-house">Turing House</h2>
<ul>
<li>November 2022</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lakitu/turing-house">Repository</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A hackathon project where our team built a 2D dungeon crawler game in Java
Processing. I built the backend, a Flask app that used the Twilio API to send
messages to the player as they advanced through the game, giving clues and
(hopefully) encouraging messages. I also built a chatbot interface to have a
conversation with the &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; of Alan Turing using the davinci-003 gpt model
from OpenAI.</p>
<p>Our team ended up winning the Twilio Award for our project!</p>
