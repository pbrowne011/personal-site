      <description>Hi there! My name is Patrick Browne, and I&amp;rsquo;m a student from northern MA. This is my personal website, meant to be a reference for the projects that I have worked on in the past and those that I&amp;rsquo;m working on today.
Right now, I am studying computer science at Boston University. Previously, I worked at a startup called ProPhone (now Topline Pro (YC W21)), where I helped service professionals to grow their businesses online.</description>
