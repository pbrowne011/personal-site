      <description>Hi there! This is my personal website, meant to be a reference for the projects that I have worked on in the past. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit empty, as I haven&amp;rsquo;t done many projects yet. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to think up something more clever using Markdown for this description when I get the chance.
Right now, I am studying computer science at Boston University. Previously, I worked at a startup called ProPhone (now Topline Pro (YC W21)), where I helped service professionals to grow their businesses online.</description>
