      <description>My name is Pat Browne. I like to build things, and to understand how they work. This blog is one of the places where I do that.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m currently studying computer science and statistics at Boston University. Specific areas that I am interested in include compilers and operating systems, cryptography, machine learning/AI, probability, financial markets, and number theory. You can email me at pjbrowne011 [at] gmail [dot] com.</description>
