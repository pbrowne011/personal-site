Personal website: [patbrowne.me](https://patbrowne.me/)

This is a blog for things I'm interested in. Some topics I've written about
recently include Unix utilities, cryptography, and bitwise tricks.

This website was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and
[the Ezhil theme](https://github.com/pbrowne011/ezhil).
