# Personal website

Wow, this version of VSCode is tough. Not a big fan of Ubuntu for coding,
but I guess it's necessary when your package (Hugo) requires it. In the future,
I will try using GitRepos in my Programming folder for this.

Well... here it is! My website's README.md page. The hackathon
inspired me to start working on projects again. I'll see how this works, but
hopefully it leads to some positive progress on the programming front.
My sole goals are 1) to learn as much as possible as quickly as possible and
2) to gain enough money to live comfortably. For me, living comfortably qualifies 
right now as $80,000 in today's dollars, with other stipends for cool hardware (but
not necessary) and the ability to buy books (more necessary, as even though they don't
travel well, they're essential to learn more).

This is meant to be a planner for my personal website. Hopefully I can keep track of things here!
Right now, I plan for it to be very simple: include a link to my GitHub profile, an "
About Me" page, and a list of the projects I have completed (and want to show) right now. 
I guess we'll see how it goes from here, but I hope it works well. I may add in the anime.js or 
particles.js background animation at some point... those are cool.

Other than that, time to start working on publishing the site. Maybe it will be up tonight.
