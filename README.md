Personal website: [patbrowne.com](https://patbrowne.com/)

This is a blog for things I'm interested in. Some topics I've written about
recently include shift registers, Unix utilities, and bitwise tricks.

This website was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [the Ezhil
theme](https://github.com/pbrowne011/ezhil). It is currently hosted on [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (someday on
[Cloudflare](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)...)
