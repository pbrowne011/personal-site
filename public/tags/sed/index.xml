      <description>&lt;p&gt;As someone who may or may not procrastinate, I find myself &lt;a href=&#34;https://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html&#34;&gt;shaving
yaks&lt;/a&gt;
occasionally. One such yak shave occurred recently while working on a project
for my operating systems class. We were provided with an assembly file written
in x86 GNU assembly syntax. I wondered if the file contained any instructions I
wasn&amp;rsquo;t familiar with or hadn&amp;rsquo;t used in awhile. My first task was to figure out
all of these unique assembly instructions, look them up in the Intel manual, and
use them (plus 1-2 others) for the code I was going to write.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
