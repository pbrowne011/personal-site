      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the classes that I&amp;rsquo;m taking this semester is on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bu.edu/academics/cas/courses/cas-ma-583/&#34;&gt;stochastic processes&lt;/a&gt;.
Stochastic processes are sequences of random variables $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$,
where $n$ represents a specific moment in time.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The first topic we&amp;rsquo;ve
focused on this semester has been
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain&#34;&gt;Markov chains&lt;/a&gt;, specific
stochastic models that only depend on the current state. They are unique in
that future events are only affected by where you currently are, not where you
have been in the past. Markov chains arise from the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://statproofbook.github.io/P/prob-tot.html&#34;&gt;law of total probability&lt;/a&gt;,
which is a way to express the probability of an event as the sum of many other
probabilities. In general, when dealing with a stochastic process, you have
to condition the probability of an event on all previous events before, as they
all have some effect on whether or not you reach that state. Mathematically,
this can be expressed as&lt;/p&gt;</description>
